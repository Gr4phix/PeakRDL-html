<h3>ATTR_SMB</h3>

<p>Single Message Buffer (ATTR.SMB): If set to '1', the HBA has one message buffer
that is shared for messages to transmit and messages received. In this case,
unsolicited receive messages are not supported and it is software's responsibility to
manage access to this buffer. If cleared to '0', there are separate receive and transmit
buffers such that unsolicited messages could be supported.</p>
